                    <h2>Who is MLM?</h2>
                    <p>MLM is short for MusicLaurensMudde. Laurens Mudde was born in 2005 on the 28th of January in the
                       Netherlands, Hilversum. He grew up there and lives there till this day with both his parents and his two 
                       brothers to whom he refers in his song "Brotherhood". He is now 17 years old and studies Communication and 
                       Multimedia Design in Amsterdam, which he mentions in his song "Different". 
                    </p> 
                    <p>Laurens' favorite rapper is NF (Nathan Feuerstein) as they are somewhat similar.
                         Both are Christian and let their religion be part of their music. An example from NF in his song "Real" 
                         (one of Laurens most favorite rap lines ever): <q>If God ain't real, real isn't</q>. An example from 
                         Laurens is: <q>I know God has made a place in heaven for me and suicide won't secure me that seat.</q> 
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides this, both their raps are initiated as a coping mechanism for mental struggles. 
                       Even though there is quite a difference in the mental struggles themselves, they both write partly because it helps 
                       them mentally as well. Now it will not come as surprise that Laurens started rapping, partly as coping mechanism, 
                       because of NF who he sees as his idol.</p>

                        the song "Apology" in which he says: <q>Listening to some of NF raps, thinking about how well it
                        connects</q>.</figcaption>

                        <h2>How did MLM start?</h2>
                        <p>Laurens' first rap was written in 2022 for a school project. He found this very fun and since he had not tried 
                           rapping before, both for fun and as coping mechanism for his mental struggles he decided to keep on doing it. 
                           One the first raps Laurens wrote was "Chapter I: Quiet!", here Laurens for the first time gave the "voices" in his 
                           head a vocal form, letting their words and things he believed be written down on paper. Soon it became a place 
                           where Laurens darkest thoughts were spread out over a beat and came the battle from Laurens his head onto the paper 
                           and the mic. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Following his big idol NF he started to write more and more rap, a part of this reason was the fact 
                           that Laurens came to a personal bottom point in life. On the age of 17 his "demons" had caught up from his past and 
                           when he also went thru a bad, but necessary break-up he found himself on the bottom, stuck and not able to move. 
                           His rap starts to become more dark and it's clear he has been suicidal quite sometimes, barely able to function on a 
                           day-to-day basis. He also talks about going to his therapist and the fact he now takes medication, which he revealed 
                           in his latest song "Slecht Zelfbeeld". 
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides this there is one more theme that seems to keep popping up in his rap which is that he feels different than 
                            everybody around him, so far to even say "Different! Yeah I've always had that feeling." now does this not mean he 
                            feels better, with his inferiority complex that would be a bit weird, but different after all. As Christian he has 
                            said he feels like his values are different than most people he has met, he is also called an "old soul" which comes 
                            down to the fact his emotional development is a bit further than most boys of his age, and also probably explains why 
                            is quite a serious person.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>In which language does MLM rap?</h2>
                        <p>Again following his idol Laurens started of his rapping in English, a language he everything but has mastered over the 
                            years. In his second year of highschool Laurens could barely speak a word English, a insult to his best friend who loved
                            the language and also almost got the max score on the Cambridge exam. Since than his best friend forced him to learn 
                            English by speaking only English to him, and forcing Laurens to respond in English. This worked very well since Laurens 
                            ended up getting an "7.4" for his reading exam and an "8" overall. 
                        </p>
                        <p>But even though Laurens learned quick, he learned it by talking to his best friend, which meant his vocabulary still 
                            wasn't great and his writing even worse. Eventually after writing for almost a year in English Laurens switched to 
                            dutch to work on the technical side of rap, without having a language barrier in his way, making it harder to write and 
                            rap out loud. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Even though Laurens disliked Dutch rap, or writing in Dutch for that matter, he still did it for his own improvement. His first rap 
                            was "De aard die ik koos" and although his language might have changed, his struggles did not which was also extremely 
                            clear in this rap.
                        </p>
