            <h1>Follow MLM on Social Media!</h1>
            <p>Follow MLM on social media so you can stay up-to-date to all his music and even get some sneak peeks of what is going on behind the screens! This is also a beautiful way to show your respect, appreciation and love for our artist by commenting on his posts and sharing the music with others! Besides this you'll be able to get notifications when MLM drops his second album:<em>Crossroad</em>or others surprise songs! Or you can download his music from Spotify and/or put it in your playlist so you'll always be able to listen to the rapper! And of course you could in the future maybe get notified or the rapper does a tour, and if so, also when, where and how!</p>

        <p>MusicLaurensMudde does not mean to offend anybody with his rap and hopes that everyone can try and respect the 
            message he is trying to give, or accept that MLM just tries to cope with most of his feelings thru rap.
