            <h1>What does MLM think about NF and Eminem?</h1>
            <blockquote>Both are remarkable rappers, of course, I mean have you read their lyrics? They are both insane, in
                different ways, but still truly insane when it comes down to the rap world. Eminem for instance is put
                in the conversation of one of the best rapper ever, and deserved so! He bends words, he creates cadences
                that are just mind breaking, he is one of the best with the pen ever for me and a whole lot of other
                people out there.</blockquote>
