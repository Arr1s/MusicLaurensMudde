            <h1>Music</h1>
            <p>Underneath here are all the songs MLM has ever made, released and unreleased. The songs will start with
                the newest released songs and build off to the eldest and can be separated in two sections. The first
                section is MLM's English songs and the second is his Dutch songs. Besides that, there will be a little
                information about the song, about who or what the song is with some of MLM's thoughts.</p>
            <section class="flexbox">

                    <h2>Album 1: The Introduction</h2>
                    <p> <em>The Introduction </em> is MLM's first ever album and it officially starts off with <em>Chapter I: Quiet! </em>
                        and ends with <em>Ending on a Note</em>. 
                        It is the first album ever produced by MLM which contains both English and Dutch rap. As the
                        title of the album says, it is a introduction to the world of MLM, a little insight on his
                        struggles, feelings and thoughts, as well as some of his inner patterns that are very hard to explain
                        through words. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Something MLM thinks can be quite funny about this album is that you can hear progress in his lines, rhyme schemes and more. For example, in his first few songs there is no chorus, and than out of what seems no where is does start using a chorus. MLM also said that he was not sure yet what he should all say and what he should
                        keep behind closed doors, but he has revealed he wants to let people know more about him in his
                        next songs,
                        besides his struggles. </p>

                <h4 id="Ending_on_a_note">Ending On A Note</h4>
                <p>Ending On a Note is officially the last song in MLM's album: The Introduction. In his own words: "It
                    is a last scream of anger, coming from listening and trusting people that it really is not that bad,
                    while the opposite has been proven way too many times." MLM even goes so far to basically scream
                    into the mic and beg God to show somewhat of a path that will bring him back to the light.</p>

                    <p>Ending On A Note:</p>
                    <p>Hey Lau, you doing alright? <br>
                        Yeah man, I’m doing just fine. <br>
                        Although it’s been a bit weird lately <br>
                        Why is that? <br>
                        Well I still don’t really know why I hate me <br>
                        Still don’t know why a girl would ever date me <br>
                        Still don’t know why for every single bad thing I blame me <br>
                        Still don’t know how the end is gonna break me <br>
                        The end? <br>
                        Yeah the end of my life <br>
                        End of my time <br>
                        End of acting like I’m just fine (Whoo) </p>

                    <p>End of the fight <br>
                        End of this life <br>
                        End my mind, that won’t be stopping for a stop sign (nahh) </p>

                    <p>End of this rhyme <br>
                        End of everything that was mine (oeh) </p>

                    <p>Yeah, let's get back on it </p>

                    <p>Why does everybody keep telling me everything is gonna be just fine <br>
                        I do not see it, you better keep mouth shut, you just got me stressing out <br>
                        My mental stability has been going for a run, and I don’t see it coming back <br>
                        Life has changed a lot these years, turning bitter is always something where my fear is (ey)
                        <br>
                        Look who here is, it’s that kid with no real depression, yeah <br>
                        Says he’s lonely like he lacks attention (hah) <br>
                        Oh did I forget to mention <br>
                        This is what I think of every single morning <br>
                        Trying to make no reaction, <br>
                        But they laugh and say: that's so adoring 
                    </p>

                    <p>You know how it’s like <br>
                        When you have nobody you trust enough<br>
                        To talk about your problems, so you’re just acting tough <br>
                        And just tell them stuff, that isn’t even real <br>
                        Not that I don’t have no friends or family <br>
                        That ask me how I am, but every time they do BAM <br>
                        Closed the door, all my feelings locked inside, <br>
                        Nobody it will open for, just like me in my bedroom <br>
                        Every single evening, sick and tired of who I am WHOO </p>

                    <p>Take a look these lines, are you hearing em? <br>
                        No empty words here, keep filling them <br>
                        No one is living the same lives, everyone is different, so why assume People how I’m feeling
                        then! <br>
                        Trying to figure out reality, have to see, who I want to be, <br>
                        awfully, confusing, hard to breath, <br>
                        start to hear, all these people, selling me, telling me, their advice, doesn’t work for me
                        (noooo) </p>

                    <p>Always been a little private,<br>
                        Can be difficult to talk with, <br>
                        Feeling tired of trying, when other people don’t even take the courage of fighting<br>
                        Knowing I could go to God but I hide (oeh) <br>
                        Don’t know why cause I know how he is on my side (nah) <br>
                        Don’t know why cause I know he’ll bring a light (whoo) <br>
                        Don’t know why cause I know he died for me too! </p>

                    <p>I wanna talk to me, deep inside myself, <br>
                        Where me, the little kid is screaming out for help <br>
                        Have to be, pushing perfect had no idea that I would fell, so deep <br>
                        To scared to say what I believe, to be the core of my problems playing hide and seek, <br>
                        Lies I’m telling myself, ain’t want to see, what is becoming of the future me, <br>
                        Please I beg you set me free, I don’t wanna die from my mind that’s on a killing spree, <br>
                        Trying to find the key, so I can run away <br>
                        But I know I have to deal with this, <br>
                        Hey my friends are you seeing this? <br>
                        This one goes to those who are the closest to me, but not related, <br>
                        Will never see our friendship fading, <br>
                        how you’re gonna tell me I’m less than you when you know my hatred, <br>
                        is coming from there, feels like my minds has got invaded, <br>
                        by something dangerous, is it calculated? Please lord, tell me I can make it! </p>

                <p>If you have read "About MLM" you already know this song, which seems to be a theme in all the songs
                    MLM produces. He feels like he is different from the rest, and as you can read in "About MLM" he
                    doesn't feel like he is better, but partly worse and partly just actually different in the values he
                    has. This mostly comes forth from being an old soul who believes in God, while all his friends either
                    don't believe in God or aren't an old soul, which means MLM is emotionally developed a bit more and
                    can put his feelings and thoughts over into clear words most of the time, while most of his friends
                    struggle with this. </p>

                    <p>Different:</p>
                    <p>Studying started, free time has parted <br>
                        Anxiety came back, has been hitting harder, <br>
                        Gotta attack but the doubt is the master <br>
                        Have the feeling like I’m lonely faster, <br>
                        Like nobody has my back <br>
                        I know this ain’t war, but I’m not joking <br>
                        Haven’t talked much to my friend and I know that that led <br>
                        To me, kinda feeling lonely, <Br>
                        But I’d rather be alone, than having people making me feel alone only </p>

                    <p>And I’ve tried to be owning my thoughts, <br>
                        But I got so much stress that it makes me feel like I’m chocking yeah, <br>
                        And I’m to scared to make some moves <br>
                        To scared to actually choose <br>
                        Cause it feels like I’m broken <Br>
                        I don’t or I should let my inner beast loose <br>
                        But staying here is a lose lose <br>
                        I just want to do something that proofs to me, and feels real <br>
                        None of y’all stood in my shoes </p>

                    <p>Different, yeah I’ve always had feeling <br>
                        Different, like my life has got a hidden meaning <br>
                        Different, even in how people have been treating me <br>
                        Different, In how I’ve been seeing the world <br>
                        Believing in God, need no one further <br>
                        Could take another beating, <br>
                        Don’t care how much I'm hurting, <br>
                        I’m already bleeding <br>
                        Unlike others I’d be out here feeding <br>
                        On my thoughts, yeah there are lots of them <br>
                        Feels like I’m about to be cheating, by being, believing <br>
                        In the feeling that would be so freeing <br>
                        Cause I’m freaking out, trying to be killing the doubt <br>
                        But nothing seems to work so I guess I’ll never be actually proud </p>

                    <p>The complexity of my demons is too difficult <br>
                        Respectfully, back off they ain’t typical <Br>

                        Fighting along the way yes it hurts, unthinkable <Br>
                        Lying I don’t want people to stay cause I’m cursed, than all the anger will burst, <br>
                        yeah there are millions of people who live in these worlds

                        So stop looking, stop booking a place in my head, while I’m doing <Br>
                        Everything I can, to not take another back, keeping myself on track, <br>
                        Want me to leave for my mental health, but I’ll make it, let’s bet <br>
                        Ain’ t surprised if you didn’t t get that </p>

                        But till than, I might be alive, but I’m not believing in life </p>

                <h4 id="someone_to_hold">Someone To Hold (unreleased)</h4>
                <p>The second unreleased song of MLM is Someone To Hold, now the reason this song was not recorded and
                    released is very simple: although the Lyrics were alright, the rhyme schemes were very poorly and
                    the rhythm was so bad MLM just decided no, not gonna do this. Besides this, we see MLM also talking
                    about his ex-girlfriend again, saying it seems to destroy him every time he goes to athletics and she
                    is there, what isn't fair. Later on MLM explained that the fact it isn't fair isn't just for him,
                    but also for her, since they made up and MLM doesn't want to drag their past back into the start of
                    their friendship after the break-up.</p>

                    <p>Someone to Hold:</p>
                    <p>Look, for 5 years nobody seemed interested in me, <br>
                        Had friends and family but kept questioning <br>
                        Had been praying, to fall in love <br>
                        Have someone to hold me<br>
                        Always put on a smile, but someone to look through the whole thing<br>
                        God heard me, and he knew it would be tempting for me to stay<br>
                        When I should’ve learned my lesson<br>
                        So he decided to keep on besting me in the same act over and over<br>
                        Let’s go back to athletics<br>
                        Found love there, but now every time I go there my body breakdown<br>
                        No it’s not fair <br>
                        I’m trying to go through with it<br>
                        Put on a poker face, but I’m losing it<br>
                        Yeah, yeah I’m losing it<br>
                        Yeah, yeah I’m losing it </p>

                    <p>Don’t want to fall in love, don’t need a dove<br>
                        Not acting tough, it’s just been rough<br>
                        Don’t want to overload a partner with this stuff<br>
                        Don’t need a hug, too uncomfortable <br>
                        There is time to talk, but please God <br>
                        Not another person to whom I fall in love <br>
                        If it ain’t perfect and will break my heart,<br>
                        Please have mercy and let it all stop </p>

                    <p>I don’t want to feel so lonely anymore <br>
                        Die, die, what are all these memories good for<br>
                        Why, why do the bad ones stay, while the good just leave<br>
                        And I would like to believe, that when I’m looking at the future me<br>
                        At the end it isn’t just me!<br>
                        And I eventually find someone who is actually good for me <br>
                        Pushes me physically, keeps my by God and helps me mentally </p>

                    <p>So much things going on inside of my mind<br>
                        Try to be improving every single day of my life<br>
                        But it seems helpless like I’m waisting my time <br>
                        Have tried so many things, but it just proves that I’ll never be fine <br>
                        Yeah, yeah, I’ll never be fine </p>

                    <p>you might be asking yourself,<br>
                        What does this have to do with someone to love?<br>
                        And hold on to?<br>
                        Now stop, as the clock keeps ticking and please just listen </p>

                    <p>Don’t want to fall in love, don’t need a dove<br>
                        Not acting tough, it’s just been rough<br>
                        Don’t want to overload a partner with this stuff<br>
                        Don’t need a hug, too uncomfortable <br>
                        There is time to talk, but please God <br>
                        Not another person to whom I fall in love <br>
                        If it ain’t perfect and will break my heart,<br>
                        Please have mercy and let it all stop </p>

                    <p>And maybe I just need a little more time<br>
                        Will always take longer if you’ve been crossing the line<br>
                        Recovering from all the wounds will be taking a while<br>
                        It’s almost been a year and I don’t cry,<br>
                        But my mind takes me back to every single lie <br>
                        Thinking about the part where I can finally call someone mine </p>

                <h4 id="stressed">Stressed</h4>
                <p>Once again the title already gives a big part of the song away, and is about quite a specific period
                    in MLM's life where he had around the 5 panic attacks everyday, which caused a mental breakdown just
                    before a week of exams that led to failing 2 out of 3 classes. If you listen the song you'll hear a
                    very sudden switch of paste from, not that fast to really fast, this symbolizes the calm he felt
                    before and the overflow of feelings after or while having a panic attack.</p>

                    <p>Stressed:</p>
                    <p>Yeah it’s one of those evenings, <br>
                        Man I don’t know what to be believing in <br>
                        I don’ t to be sealing me, not allowed to be dealing with everything inside of my head <br>
                        Can please someone start teaching me, how to find yourself back <br>
                        Oh I see you looking at me, are you feeling that <br>
                        Not just lost and alone, but feeling whack <br>
                        Waking up in the middle of the night I’d be like HEY <br>
                        What’s going on, I know I’m stressed, I’m already out of bed, <br>
                        I look at my consciousness, it shakes his head and he says </p>

                    <p>I’m not the reason you keep having these panic attacks, <br>
                        Are stressing again, can’t go to a friend, why do you think I’m upset <br>
                        Have this fantasy that I’m not a last man stand, <br>
                        Like this is the last time I'll actually try <br>
                        Last time I’ll actually fight back <br>
                        Last time I’ll actually bite back <br>
                        Why do I stress <br>
                        I know I’m convinced that I’m less <br>
                        But does that have to mean I’m such a mess <br>
                        It’s like I'm 24/7 stressed<br>
                        I can feel it burning inside of my chest <br>
                        Please, for once just leave me alone and give me some rest <br>
                        Yeah, give me some rest </p>

                    <p>I’m laying down on the ground, not making a sound <br>
                        Hoping I’ll never be found <br>
                        I'm breaking partly because of the doubt <br>
                        No I'm not faking, trying to say it oud loud <br>
                        But it’s taking everything not got lost in the cloud, yeah <br>
                        I’m barely functioning, but at the same time I’d be studying, <br>
                        Even though that doesn’t make sense cause I keep on stumbling, <br>
                        On the same hurdle I always keep crumbling, <br>
                        It's like I’m young again and keep on mumbling, <br>
                        I just want to be humble man, <br>
                        And wish I knew what my consciousness meant by </p>

                    <p>I’m not the reason you keep having these panic attacks, <br>
                        Are stressing again, can’t go to a friend, why do you think I’m upset <br>
                        Have this fantasy that I’m not a last man stand, <br>

                <p>This song was written with the purpose of dealing with the fact that MLM felt like everyone was
                    asking him things and it really started to drain his energy. Now is this not entirely true, but the
                    second chorus of the song is big part of that reason, since MLM just wants to be happy and relaxed
                    again, but the "voices" in his head never seem to leave him alone, which was another reason to write
                    this song.</p>

                    <p>Just Leave Me Alone:</p>
                    <p>Lately I’ve realized I’m not the perfect son, <br>
                        Not that I’ve ever been, but you know what I mean, <br>
                        I think my parents know where it comes from, ain’ t a excuse to act angry and dumb <br>
                        I know they want to give me all the help I want, but that is part of the problem, <br>
                        Nothing that works, everything hurts,<br>
                        That is the reason for this song <br>
                        I don’ t mean to be mean, I don’t want to be rude, but look <br>
                        Have someone I love, sneak up to my room, want to catch me off guard?<br>
                        I do not know, but if so, don’t knock on my door <br>
                        One second enough to put on my mask, act happy like everything is fine and just laugh <br>
                        Don't try this again, you're making me mad, <br>
                        Somebody's nose is about to be cracked! </p>

                    <p>Just leave me alone! Leave me alone, <br>
                        Please, just leave me alone! <br>
                        I can’ t take this anymore, leave me alone<br>
                        Just leave me alone! <br>
                        I’m not in the zone, talking about the problems with you guys is just breaking me more and more,
                        <br>
                        Yeah, slowly everything is getting worse and worse, what is this curse that hurts? <br>
                        Just leave me alone, yeah leave me alone <br>
                        JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! (whoo) <br>
                        Yeah, leave me alone (nahh) <br>
                        Yeah leave me alone, just leave me alone! Leave me alone, <br>
                        Yeah I wanna be left alone, what is the problem, just leave me alone
                    </p>

                    <p>I know it’s aggressive, I know my aggression is getting the better of me when I’m rapping, <br>
                        This ain’ t only to people but also to the voices that won’t shut up, in my mind, <br>
                        Please let me be King, making my thoughts sing, supportive messages till it brings, <br>
                        Me in a happy place, but sadly enough I’m not in that phase, end of the case <br>
                        Still stuck in the beginning, <br>
                        Where I am convinced that I would be winning, <br>
                        All I have to do is listen to the voices they will help me bring in all the results, <br>
                        But now I am thinking, they’ve been lying to me and now I am sinking <br>
                        Hoping they left me for dead, running away, <br>
                        But too bad, they stayed, you’re company is something I won’ t be missing, </p>

                    <p>Just leave me alone! Leave me alone, <br>
                        Please, just leave me alone! <br>
                        I can’ t take this anymore, leave me alone <br>
                        Just leave me alone! <br>
                        I’m not in the zone, talking about the problems with you guys is just breaking me more and more,
                        <br>
                        Yeah, slowly everything is getting worse and worse, what is this curse that hurts? <br>
                        Just leave me alone, yeah leave me alone<br>
                        JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! (whoo) <br>
                        Yeah, leave me alone (nahh) <br>
                        Yeah leave me alone, just leave me alone! Leave me alone, <br>
                        Yeah I wanna be left alone
                    </p>

                    <p>Normally I go quick, but this time I'm sick (for real) <br>
                        Of repeating my feelings, don't get me wrong <br>
                        I'm loving my friends, won't need to say that again (yeah) <br>
                        And honestly I don't expect you guys to understand a word that I meant <br>
                        MLM that is the brand </p>

                <p>Another very personal rap, written just after Anger Has Talked To Me, this rap was written while
                    being on vacation in France. The name already says it, but it is about MLM's brothers, to who he
                    looks up to and has learned a lot from them. He hopes that with this rap he has been able to show
                    the appreciation he feels for the both of them.</p>

                        Besides I'm way to scared for it <Br>
                        Making a plan, but anxiety comes up and I quit, it makes me sick <Br>
                        I want to connect more with my brothers and figured <Br>
                        That because we don’t talk much our relationship suffers <Br>
                        I remember strong the moments where the room get's filled up with our laughters </p>

                    <p>Even my third year in highschool german teacher <Br>
                        Was telling me to hold our brothers close and that's what I chose but I do not know<Br>
                        How to start telling them they are the ones who are making me feel like home <Br>
                        I know it's hard to get close when I keep my distance <Br>
                        Hardly listen, yeah but I'm really missing the both of you <Br>
                        And I know that talking about emotions is something we hardly do <Br>
                        But that's the point I want to get to cause <Br>
                        I want you guys not just to be my family but feel like it too </p>

                    <p>I'm scared to death to see us fall apart <Br>
                        Mostly because of my entire life the both of you've always been part yeah <Br>
                        The both of you were there from the start and believe me <Br>
                        When I'm telling you guys this from the bottom of my heart </p>

                    <p>I don't want to lose the people who I look up the most <Br>
                        I hope how much I really care about you guys now shows <Br>
                        Yeah this ain't a show I've been crying in the car wishing you guys were close <Br>
                        You guys ain't just part of my life but part of my home <Br>
                        I wished I had earlier picked up the phone dialing your numbers hell I am nervous <Br>
                        Our past has been written in stone but I want to change our future cause <Br>
                        As my brothers you guys are perfect <Br>
                        You guys can't be replaced by another you guys can't be replaced by a lover <Br>
                        I guess all I’m trying to say is that I love the both of you forever </p>

                    <p>I remember the times that we were younger <Br>
                        I would fight with one of my brothers the one that was younger <Br>
                        In the mean while the other would be calling my back <Br>
                        Convincing me at soccer to stay and not be so mad <Br>
                        I left it like that but now looking back <Br>
                        The reason I was a good goalkeeper one of the best <Br>
                        Was because both them pushed me that is why I was better than the rest </p>

                    <p>And how could I not be? Got an example for socializing <Br>
                        At home they would be challenging my intelligence <Br>
                        And even though I was always wrong the showed me how to stay strong <Br>
                        Loyal committed could give you a list but it would going on and on <Br>
                        Lesson taught from this song? A pair like my brothers there is only one </p>

                    <p>I'm scared to death to see us fall apart <Br>
                        Mostly because of my entire life the both of you've always been part yeah <Br>
                        The both of you were there from the start and believe me <Br>
                        When I'm telling you guys this from the bottom of my heart </p>

                    <p>I don't want to lose the people who I look up the most <Br>
                        I hope how much I really care about you guys now shows<Br>

                <p>This was a very personal song for MLM, and as you can guess if you listen it or read the Lyrics, this
                    is about his ex-girlfriend. The break-up was quite messy and MLM was very upset for he had defended
                    his ex-girlfriend against the arguments of his friends, during their relationship and even
                    afterwards, while he had heard she had shit talked him even through out their relationship. The
                    interesting part about this rap is mostly that it was written almost six months after the eventual
                    break-up, the reason for this is that MLM the first six months after break-up tried to cope with it
                    in other ways than writing about it and just let time do it's work. This only worked half and
                    eventually came to a boiling point after which he decided writing about it was the only way to
                    really get his thoughts out.</p>

                    <p>Anger Has Talked To Me:</p>
                    <p>I have been thinking a lot about anger lately, <br>
                        My mental stability has got something in the making, <br>
                        Why do I never let my anger out even though my body is shaking <br>
                        By, calm side die and let my anger fly <br>
                        I never talk about things I feel people have done to me, <br>
                        Got it all closed up if needed for another century and maybe than eventually, but you see, <br>
                        Anger has talked to me, time to give him the key, <br>
                        He opens the door, down on the floor, <br>
                        scattered pieces of my heart breaking more and more let’s get to the core! </p>

                    <p>I remember when you told me, while crying, you were scared you didn’t have the commitment, <br>
                        And I was just thinking, how you have been hitting, the last nail in the coffin of my happy
                        living,<br>
                        Okay now I’m just lying, I've always hated myself, but it seems like you’ve been trying, <br>
                        To kill the last hope I had for me in stealth, oh and you ended it well (oh no wait, I did) <br>
                        I remember walking up the stairs of my school, thinking of you, <br>
                        Felt scared and was having a panic attack too, what was I fool, <br>
                        Keeping things going even though my friends told me to, break it off <br>
                        Should've listened to my crew of loyal friends <br>
                        when they were telling me that het problems we were having weren’t new, <br>
                        but were still hurting (woo) </p>

                    <p>You broke my heart and a lot of things made me sad, <br>
                        But when I was crying and texted you, I figured was all you said, yeah <br>
                        And I was scared to death too, cause every single time you were mad or in a awful mood,<br>
                        You would stop talking even though I had no clue, even though I was begging you, <br>
                        To come back to me and stop pushing me away, <br>
                        A happy ending is all I ever wanted us to be </p>

                    <p>You thought I was done? (Ha) <br>
                        You told me I was acting hypocritical, how convenient, how have I not been seeing this, <br>
                        Ain't it kinda typical, that I’m in the wrong about our communication, <br>
                        Even though you never told me what was going on, what a sensation, yeah <br>
                        And you’d be giving me the cold shoulder, <br>
                        hell you would even hold the door open for me walk out if things were actually over <br>
                        But you kept coming back to me, <br>
                        You told me you were pushed away from a train, but than you told me it was all a lie <br>
                        And I know you were in pain, but all I could be thinking was are you insane? (And Dean called it
                        out) <br>
                        True, but that ain’t so new <br>
                        Dean has been right all along, to push me for us to be over and done <br>
                        No relation is perfect and I know it can be tough, but if it destroys it’s been enough </p>

                    <p>I’m anxious, having panic attacks and social anxiety (came from you) <br>
                        Never thought my imagination lacks the variety of reasons how I've been trying not to be crying,
                        <br>
                        Needed to trust you when you’re lying, nah <br>
                        Shit talked me even though we were together, should’ve known what that meant (wah)<br>
                        Now to be fair I was already in a bad place, but I never expected it to be the case, <br>
                        That the person I thought I loved the most, <br>
                        didn’t care that she brought me down into my worst state <br>
                        Had a hard time keeping myself straight, love made me blind I didn’t want to see the signs <br>
                        That somethings weren’t fine, waisted a lot of time thinking you were the person of my life
                        (yeah) <br>
                        And I suck in hating, somebody hurts me two days later memories start fading, <br>
                        But I guess nobody brought me this close to breaking, close to making a fatal decision, <br>
                        And I know you were faking you didn’t care, but I almost gave my soul for the taking
                    </p>

                    <p>You broke my heart and a lot of things made me sad, <br>
                        But when I was crying and texted you, I figured was all you said, yeah <br>
                        And I was scared to death too, cause every single time you were mad or in a awful mood, <br>
                        You would stop talking even though I had no clue, even though I was begging you, <br>
                        To come back to me and stop pushing me away, <br>
                        A happy ending is all I ever wanted us to be </p>

                    <p>Second time you broke up with me, life looked bad, disgusted who I had to be, <br>
                        Felt like I had done something illegal, your friends even threatened to call the police, <br>
                        But what would you tell them huh, had I asked you or not (Uhh) <br>
                        How did I not see you’re so manipulative (wugh) <br>
                        And I try to forgive and forget, but every time I think back, <br>
                        I’d in my room, crying in my bed, cause I was stressed out so bad, <br>
                        Partly because I felt responsible for when you were sad <br>
                        Offered help, but you didn’t want any, leave me alone was the only that you said, <br>
                        Well that’s what you want, so that’s what you can get </p>

                    <p>You broke my heart and a lot of things made me sad, <br>
                        But when I was crying and texted you, I figured was all you said, yeah<br>
                        And I was scared to death too, cause every single time you were mad or in a awful mood, <br>
                        You would stop talking even though I had no clue, even though I was begging you, <br>
                        To come back to me and stop pushing me away, <br>
                        A happy ending is all I ever wanted us to be </p>

                <h4 id="happy">Happy</h4>
                <p>A misleading title as MLM starts his first verse. He is not happy at all and this song is from the
                    bottom of his heart as MLM remembers 8-year old Laurens, just wishing that eventually he'll be
                    happy, but now looking back nothing of it all seems to get true of that. And he starts questioning
                    or he even deserves to be happy, which also comes back in the song. This is MLM's goal still,
                    becoming happy with himself, his life and the people he has in it, after all he says "What does
                    everything mean if you ain't happy."</p>

                    <p>Happy:</p>
                    <p>Ey yeah, y'all might have looked at the title and thought that good right, <br>
                        he is in good place, so goodbye <br>
                        But honestly I'm not, honestly I'm waiting for the drop, (there it is) </p>

                    <p>Now that’s out of the way, what would you say when I'm asking you on what level you want to play?
                        <br>
                        Where you wanna end up in life, are okay with where you at, <br>
                        are you gonna shoot for the stars or failure gonna scare you away! <br>
                        Being happy is my number one life goal, but you know what they say, <br>
                        the higher you climb the longer you fall, so I changed, <br>
                        my number one life goal, nowadays my highest priority is to not put a knife in my throat (whoo)
                    </p>

                    <p>I think I've figured life out (oh) <br>
                        What does everything mean if you ain't happy (wauw) <br>
                        What does everything mean if you can't look at yourself in the mirror tho <br>
                        Can you look People eye to eye in real life no! <br>
                        What’s wrong, I don't know <br>
                        Well actually I do <br>
                        I've just been wanting to be happy since I'm 8 years (true) <br>
                        I don't get it, <br>
                        what's that, knock knock, <br>
                        who's there? <br>
                        Not happy </p>

                    <p>Please please let me be happy <br>
                        All I ever wanted is being happy <br>
                        Scared I'll end up sadly, please let me be happy <br>
                        What am I doing wrong? I don't understand, what am I lacking? <br>
                        Am I maybe unworthy of being happy <br>
                        Yeah, I don't get it </p>

                    <p>I get why everybody wants to be financially rich, <br>
                        doesn't mean I agree with most certainty cuz you good lose everything in a flinch, <br>
                        I just wanna fly high, give every cloud a high five, not worrying about a nice try, <br>
                        but I guess our world doesn't work like that, every single day wake up and you have to fight
                        back, <br>
                        no progression if you're comfortable, <br>
                        no progression if you never fall, <br>
                        failing a hundred time before you make it is the law <br>
                        None is perfect, everyone has their own flaws, <br>
                        making peace with them is important, <br>
                        but for me as impossible as counting the stars, </p>

                    <p>I know I'm not the only one, <br>
                        but what does it change I feel less than everybody <br>
                        so I ain't the same, <br>

                <h4 id="respect_your_try">Respect Your Try</h4>
                <p>The first verse of "Respect Your Try" is some what of a masterpiece of MLM, all the lines together
                    have a very deep meaning, a theme that plays with teenagers and even young adults, and maybe even
                    adults, because the question is, who do you want to be, realistically, when are you happy with how
                    you represent yourself and the people around you? Which gets followed up with accepting failure,
                    since it's part of the process and not everything will go right, some things might even go horribly
                    wrong, but that doesn't have to mean things will stay that way or happened for the bad. Sometimes
                    greater things come forth of great failure's. </p>

                    <p>Respect Your Try:</p>
                    <p>You ain’t have to be perfect, you’re allowed to still look for your purpose, <br>
                        In the mean while you could still be learning, on how to become the best version of you, <br>
                        And how will you do in the future? <br>
                        Who do you want to be when you look at yourself as a person? (whoo) <br>
                        And I know that can hurt cause, you’d have to admit to yourself that you’re worth it, <br>
                        And that carrying all of those burning burdens, even though they still might be burning <br>
                        won’t any longer hold up the curtains, that block people off of your life, <br>
                        but if you fake everything are you really alive? <br>
                        You don’ t have to dump everything onto your friends, <br>
                        That might not be right, but if they’re loyal they’ll do anything to get you a light </p>

                    <p>Everybody has to try, <br>
                        Before they can rise and fly, <br>
                        Above everybody else, as long as you don’t lose your sight, <br>
                        On that what just might, <br>
                        Be the key to yourself respect when you learn to respect the outcome of every fight, <br>
                        When you gave everything and tried,<br>
                        Chose to survive and haven’t died, <br>
                        You don’t have to hide, take responsibility for your achievement, <br>
                        And when you’ll learn to respect your effort, that’ll make you shine bright <br>
                        Yeah, yeah </p>

                    <p>I know I have this obsession with progression,<br>
                        Cause I have to be perfect and it’s upsetting, <br>
                        When the pressure is too heavy and I’m lacking <br>
                        The motivation to keep my dedication going while the world is rotating, <br>
                        And my masks keep faking and I can’t stop hating myself<br>
                        And keep on draining all my energy, while there is no more in the making, <br>
                        Like emptying a lake while it’s never raining <br>
                        Like my demons looked at my happiness and said, that what I’ll be taking <br>
                        I’m scared and don’t wanna go again, cause I think that I’ll be breaking </p>

                    <p>Everybody has to try, <br>
                        Before they can rise and fly, <br>
                        Above everybody else, as long as you don’t lose your sight, <br>
                        On that what just might, <br>
                        Be the key to yourself respect when you learn to respect the outcome of the fight, <br>
                        When you gave everything and tried, <br>
                        Chose to survive and haven’t died, <br>
                        You don’t have to hide, take responsibility for your achievement, <br>
                        And when you’ll learn to respect your effort, that’ll make you shine bright <br>
                        Yeah, yeah </p>

                    <p>I know it’s easier said than done, <br>
                        Cause if you grow up with an extreme low self esteem, <br>
                        Even trying your best isn’t a whole lot of fun, <br>
                        But the only person you should compare yourself with is you, <br>
                        So how do you do, compared to the version of you from last year <br>
                        And thinking you’re not enough, I know that fear <br>
                        But staying in that headspace, not taking action, while you should be relaxing <br>
                        Does also not help you in any case, <br>
                        So go ahead, work all of your demons out of the way </p>

                <h4 id="Apology">Apology</h4>
                <p>The first unreleased song of MLM, now there were multiple reasons for MLM to not bring out this song.
                    First of all, the rhythm in this song is very complicated and doesn't sound nice to the ears. Second
                    of all, Laurens said that where "Someone To Hold" was as rap bad, but the meaning of the lines and
                    the message was okay, the message of this song he found very bad, and did not at all write it on the
                    beat, but mostly pieces of rap he thought of in his head, making the lines not at all adapt to the
                    beat, which made it eventually not even worth recording. Also is this the first time MLM reveals
                    that his therapist has suggested that he should take medication.</p>

                    <p>Apology:</p>
                    <p>Okay here we go, let me explain this. <br>
                        Normally I don't come after people, but this time I have to say it, <br>
                        Let me break it down to you. <br>
                        Although, tomorrow morning I’ll have to be up early, <br>
                        so, this will be this days last thing I’ll do. <br>
                        Listening to some rap, thinking about how well it connects, <br>
                        And how all of my friends, don’t seem to get I word that I said. <br>
                        Did you think I feel a bit sad? A little angry and mad? <br>
                        And before y’all know I’ll stand again? <br>
                        How about this might be the last text that I send! </p>

                    <p>How you’re gonna tell me I am worth less <br>
                        When you know I’m struggling with that <br>
                        I think my depression is getting cured best <br>
                        When I take out the roots from me that are convinced that I am worthless <br>
                        So you know that you’re not <br>
                        You think that is gonna stop everything that is coming from top </p>

                    <p>Ain’t it hilarious, I got these various people around me <br>
                        That can talk about emotions, but seem to know nothin’ about me <br>
                        So I’m heading out you see? Opening my mind with a key, lookin’ inside it, yeah I see I ain’t
                        free. <br>
                        My own thoughts, I gotta fight them just like I’m trying to find some happiness in myself, <br>
                        I know I’ll have to find some on my own, question tho <br>
                        What makes me happy? Those results have been lacking, <br>
                        Like my demons have been tracking, everything that has helped me, <br>
                        and gave them a helping hand, with ending them </p>

                    <p>I wish I would talk more to God, believing in him and just stop, <br>
                        doubting or the power he’s got, is enough for me to actually start, <br>
                        believing in a good ending as I now jot, the answer to all of my problems and props, <br>
                        to all of those who it costs, everything on the way out of lost, <br>
                        but remember we’ll never be the actual last, <br>
                        millions of people feel something inside them that rots, <br>
                        and the percentage of people with depression is going up fast </p>

                    <p>But still I do picture me, completely differently, from everyone around me, <br>
                        feels like my mind is instinctively killing me on purpose,<br>
                        yeah people around never get further than the surface, <br>
                        and I have to admit that it hurts cause, I know the problems is me, <br>
                        yeah cause I never get lost, <br>
                        on the burdens I carry and never let people in on my thoughts, <br>
                        lots people have been taking shots at the side of me that blasts, <br>
                        thru every bad situation it caused, <br>
                        therapist suggested medication would be better than feeling so lost, <br>
                        things of my childhood coming in fast, <br>
                        yeah life is chasing me with the problems I caused </p>

                    <p>I knew my problems would probably catch up eventually, <br>
                        you ain’t getting my apology for pouring my heart out, <br>
                        will I ever see the end of the tunnel, it’s so dark in here, <br>
                        and I’m starting to stumble, myself respect has started to crumble <br>
                        a long time ago, but I will never start to just mumble, and I’ve always tried to be humble, <br>
                        cause I’m scared own anger and ain’t that just awful, <br>
                        everybody has got a mouthful opinions about the things that I do, <br>
                        but honestly I don’t care ‘bout nobody if they ain’t listening to things that I say that are
                        true, <br>
                        and are expecting to know how it’s like to be standing in my shoes, <br>
                        those people are just making fools, of themselves, </p>

                    <p>How many times have you been sitting on the ground, feelings so down, <br>
                        too lost to ever be found, every sound, in my head is saying I’m so sorry now,<br>
                        but I'm wearing the crown, I’m the King of Mount Lau, <br>
                        I don’t even know which of you it is, anger? Sadness or doubt? <br>
                        Which one of you has been making me lately feel so stressed out (huh)? <br>
                        Come on answer question, or are too scared now, <br>
                        when I’m angry people back away like (wauw) asking what wrong, <br>
                        you gotta be joking, what wrong with me? What wrong with y’all </p>

                    <p>You know this time you can pass me the ball, <br>
                        for this time I’ll actually talk, <br>
                        I never feel right in the crowd<br>
                        I Always feel a little uncomfortable <br>
                        Is this the second time to ask you to look at these Lyrics? <br>
                        Okay now, I’m being unreasonable, y’all even have seen this yet <br>
                        But let’s make a bet, I know I’m not the main character in your story, <br>
                        so I’m forgettable, and when I disappear, my place can just be filled up, <br>
                        by someone new, but that doesn’t mean you can’t ask me how I’m doing. </p>

                <p>A song that takes a big chapter of MLM life, but is also very complicated. This is one of the first
                    songs MLM has ever written and is a bit more slow paste, compared to the rest of his songs, which he
                    somewhere does like more. Most proud is he of the line that describes a big part of his personality
                    problem with getting stuck in situations in his mind, not able to get out of it, which he puts in
                    the words "Yeah, I get caught up in the moment, like my feelings are getting overfed. It's like the
                    best get's better and the worst even lesser" very close to heart this one.</p>

                        I don’t know how to explain it mate. <br>
                        Do people really think I’m aggressive? <br>
                        Oh you think I’m to serious, a boring matter? <br>
                        Clearly you don’t know me, I’m a story teller. </p>

                        Dark memories piercing thru the perfect door before me <br>
                        Getting swarmed on by these vultures, but I stay passive <br>
                        Hiding behind my own walls, made them massive.<br>
                        But inside these walls I’ll never heal <br>
                        Sucked away in darkness is all I feel <br>

                        My demons wouldn’t leave without a deal <br>
                        That's the reason I’m not sure or this is even real! </p>

                        It's like the best gets better and worst even lesser <br>
                        That is why I feel the depression I never had <br>
                        That is why reality doesn’t exist inside in my head <br>
                        That has been the reason I keep question, do I even matter? </p>

                    <p>Yeah, this ain’t a brag song, it’s mad rap <br>
                        Yeah, I'll spit these words like a mad lad <br>

                        I’m destined for greatness, so you can go to bed <br>
                        You think this rap is just an outlet? <br>
                        You know, I highly doubt that <br>
                        For me, I got you out matched <br>
                        Yeah, my effort got you out classed <br>
                        Blowing you away with a loud blast </p>

                    <p>I don’t know myself, but I know nobody knows me well <br>
                        Yeah, I’ll force a smile even though I fell <br>
                        I got shoved away by my demons dwell,
                        They probably love that smell, <br>
                        coming from the doors of human hell <br>
                        Where you crawl back into your armoured shell, <br>
                        The isolation starts a horror tell <br>
                        locked in darkness you hear them yell <br>
                        You're so much less, <br>
                        You're never gonna be the best<br>
                        can’t you see, you’re just a mess, <br>
                        Stop bothering others, you give them stress, <br>
                        Can’t you be fun and just say yes? <br>
                        Wugh, you’re gonna wear that ugly dress? <br>
                        Wait you lost again in chess? <br>
                        How worthless do you think you are, just a guess? </p>

                    <p>this entire generation seems depressed, <br>
                        Oh you’ve got anxiety and cut yourself, not impressed <br>
                        No this shouldn’t be normal like medieval incest <br>
                        Is this the reason we can’t see how we’re all blessed <br>
                        You wake up every morning, having clothes to get yourself dressed <br>
                        Not running from a tactical warning, <br>
                        cause others have decided to go on a holy quest <br>
                        Yeah for you there is enough food and water in the rich west <br>
                        You're country ain’t getting slowly oppressed <br>
                        But how much does that actually mean, <br>
                        how many burdens are holding onto your chest <br>
                        Are you really trying to be seen? Or do you think if others believe you’re best, <br>
                        will give you the faith in yourself that you couldn’t posses </p>

                    <p>Oh you want a little insight in my brain? <br>
                        Yeah, no I don’t want to drive you insane. <br>
                        Myself image is just hatred and pain <br>
                        Myself image fails me, <br>
                        Myself image kills me,<br>
                        Not out of sadness or pain, <br>
                        Just cuz I’m convinced I’m that lame.<br>
                        We’re not the same, <br>
                        Everyone is different, <br>
                        But what makes the difference in different? <br>
                        Watch out for people that always act like they’re the victim, <br>
                        And than start acting like nothing happened<br>
                        Sometimes I would love to just hit em. <br>
                        I feel like everyone treats me differently,<br>
                        Not sure or that’s a good thing or part of the dominance I picture me, <br>
                        Am I too serious? Furious, is it my silence, religion, or mission I hunt vividly? </p>

                    <p>I hunt my dreams relentlessly <br>
                        But sometimes I would love to just hide in my fantasy <br>
                        all the doubt moving inside of me <br>
                        is something you will never see <br>
                        Feels like I’ll never be free <br>
                        Feels like I’m always running from my demons, but they won’t let me flee<br>
                        Feels like I’m traveling the water with my ghost ship stuck on the sea <br>
                        Yeah from the same movie as the ex-wife's dog who stepped on bee<br>
                        Since my break up I can feel my panic attacks coming in “one, two, three” <br>
                        I don’t mean to complain, I know who God is to me, <br>
                        I pray he pushes me to the right path, yeah who I’ve got to be <br>
                        But sometimes I feel like my demons have got me beat <br>
                        I know God has made a place in heaven for me, and suicide won’t secure me that seat </p>

                    the of his "drillmaster" a so called voice inside his head that tells him that even doing the
                    impossible is still not enough for MLM to accept that he is a worthy human being.</p>

                        A mask of deception is something you’ve always wore <br>
                        Inside you there is nothing left besides a war <br>
                        You’re confidence is something you will never restore <br>
                        You're trying to explore me, did you think would ignore it,  <br>
                        the pain on your face I adore that, trying to kick me out,  <Br>

                        I’m the reason you’re warm or dead </p>

                        <p>Every time you walk in the forest <br>
                        Asking yourself where the lord is <br>
                        Praying for help? Ha, I’m bored of this  <br>
                        You gonna shoot for the stars? Don’t bother you always  miss, <br>
                        Same with you’re bars, hoping you’re life get’s sucked away in a Dementor kiss <br>
                        And don’t say trying is worth it, cause you’ll meet my fist, <br>
                        Knocking you back down, what you've done wrong? Here's the list  </p>

                        <p>Ey, get that out my face, <br>
                        I wish I knew how to erase you, <br>
                        From my life and replace you,  <br>
                        I’m you, so why do you chase you </p>

                        <p>Cause this is the last of your days <em>boohoo</em></p>

                <p>MLM's nieuwste nummer en opnieuw in het Nederlands. Deze rap bevat vooral veel
                    patronen in MLM's gedachtengangen, bijvoorbeeld dat hij zegt "Mijn depressie niet laten zien, is
                    iets dat je gaat vaker zien" maar ook dat hij met meerdere problemen tegelijkertijd worstelt wat hij
                    ook zegt. Hiernaast heeft hij het ook over waarom hij zijn vrienden zoveel complimenten probeert te
                    geven en zo ver gaat om video's en verhalen over hun te maken. In zijn laatste verse heeft hij het
                    erover dat hij zijn grip op realiteit voelt verliezen, niet wetend wat zijn gedachten en gevoeelns
                    zijn en wat compleet nep is. Dit nummer bevat ook een diep refrein waarin MLM het heeft over 5-jaar
                    oude hij, zo gevoelig dat het leven hem begint te beïnvloeden, en niet op een positieve manier. </p>

                    <p>Slecht Zelfbeeld:</p>
                    <p>Wie denk je wel niet dat je bent? <br>
                        Om te beginnen, weet niemand die me kent <br>
                        Mijn naam misschien ooit wel bekend, <br>
                        Dossiers over wie ik ben wel verlengt<br>
                        Maar mijn verleden nooit verkent <br>
                        Is eigenlijk wel grappig als ik erover denk <br>
                        Maak video’s en verhalen voor m’n friends <br>
                        Sommige zouden zeggen dat ik ze verwen <br>
                        Maar het ligt dieper dan je denkt <br>
                        Het is dat ik trots op hen ben, zonder dat ikzelf dat gevoel ken, <br>
                        Dramatisch fleurtje erbij, last man stand zij aan zij, oftewel: <br>
                        Zij zijn geweldig en ik ben er niks bij <br>
                        Wil dat anderen naar hen kijken zoals ik, <br>
                        Want enorme talenten is wat elk van hen over beschikt! <br>
                        Maar hoe kom ik hierbij? <br>
                        Heb ik al gebouwd vanaf klein,<br>
                        (I guess) Tijd om kleine mij een lesje te leren (die?) <br>
                        Maar ik was het echt niet <br>
                        Ja, jij was het zeker vriend <br>
                        Nee, ik zweer ik niet <br>
                        Jij beweert van niet? <br>
                        Nee wat voor dimbo ben je dat je mij kiest <br>
                        Als je nu niet je mond houdt krijg je klappen like </p>

                    <p>Sinds ik 5 jaar oud ben en ouder <br>
                        Bleef mijn hart worden, kouder en kouder <br>
                        De pijn werd vertrouwder en trouwde <br>
                        Met mijn angsten, berouwde en rouwde <br>
                        De uit de hand gelopen klauwen<br>
                        Die voortdurend bleven snauwen en stouwen <br>
                        Waardoor ik een slecht zelfbeeld begon op te bouwen <br>
                        Het is tijd ik ga gek op de mic <br>
                        Niemand die op me lijkt, iedereen wijkt wanneer ik bijt (you better hide) <br>
                        Demonen bevrijd, ja ik ben bereid <br>
                        Voor de wrede lijdt, heb geen spijt <br>
                        Is nog even wachten tot mijn persoonlijkheid splijt <br>
                        Want alles draait ja voel een verandering van het tij </p>

                    <p>Ja mijn depressie niet laten zien <br>
                        Is iets wat je gaat vaker zien <br>
                        Ja ik heb een variatie <br>
                        Van problemen, wil geen aanzien <br>
                        Sluit me liever op in isolatie <br>
                        Wat een irritatie <br>
                        Geen gesprek zou kunnen maken zien <br>
                        De stemmen die hij bedient en de pijn die ik verdien <br>
                        Psycholoog smeekt, neem alsjeblieft wat medicatie <br>
                        Maar als ik eerlijk ben wil ik ik niet <br>
                        “Mankind makes it own demons” <br>
                        Dat verklaart mijn verliezen vriend <br>
                        Verbeeldingskracht is een tweesnijdend zwaard <br>
                        Werk jezelf niet omlaag, je bent meer dan dat waard <br>
                        Ja ik weet het, hypocriet toch, ik vertel het je maar <br>
                        Leef er zelf niet bij, oh wat is het leven toch zwaar HA <br>
                        Ik zeg het je, speel je de kaarten dan laten we je bevaren <br>
                        De waarheid, zal komen boven tafel <br>
                        Wat is dit voor raadsel? <br>
                        Ja lees de tekst goed en wees er klaar voor <br>
                        Geen bars missen anders ga je eraan onderdoor </p>

                    <p>Sinds ik 5 jaar oud ben en ouder<br>
                        Bleef mijn hart worden, kouder en kouder <br>
                        De pijn werd vertrouwder en trouwde <br>
                        Met mijn angsten, berouwde en rouwde <br>
                        De uit de hand gelopen klauwen <br>
                        Die voortdurend bleven snauwen en stouwen <br>
                        Waardoor ik een slecht zelfbeeld begon op te bouwen <br>
                        Het is tijd ik ga gek op de mic <br>
                        Niemand die op me lijkt, iedereen wijkt wanneer ik bijt (you better hide) <br>
                        Demonen bevrijd, ja ik ben bereid <br>
                        Voor de wrede lijdt, heb geen spijt <br>
                        Is nog even wachten tot mijn persoonlijkheid splijt <br>
                        Want alles draait ja voel een verandering van het tij </p>

                    <p>Ik voel mijn grip van realiteit, verliezen <br>
                        Ja een identiteitscrisis, nee ik heb je in de smiezen, <br>
                        ben jongen, geen meisje, sorry identificeer me als anders maar mijn gender is niet wat
                        verandert, <br>
                        hou op met dat gelanterfante, heb Vele verschillende kanten,<br>
                        ben een kameleon, maar mijn hoofd lijkt af te branden, <br>
                        elke keer dat ik in de spiegel kijk, zie ik een lijk, ja dat blijkt uit het feit dat geluk mij
                        mijdt, <br>
                        bedrukt niet blij, demonen vrij, ja ik graai, diep in mij, waar is hij? <br>
                        Is wat ik zei, en ik draai, om en maai, <br>
                        de op hand en knieën teruggekomen blijdschap uit de weg, want hij is er niets bij <br>
                        Hij kijkt op en zegt, ik weet wat je zoekt dus waarom geef je het niet toe, <br>
                        Ik weet wat daar binnen in dat hartje roert<br>
                        Maar wist niet dat je te beroerd was voor de waarheid <br>
                        Ik snuif en mompel, ik ben blij, wanneer ik gelukkig ben met mij </p>

                    <p>Sinds ik 5 jaar oud ben en ouder <br>
                        Bleef mijn hart worden, kouder en kouder <br>
                        De pijn werd vertrouwder en trouwde <br>

                <p>Al is het wat vaag over wie MLM het heeft, het is duidelijk dat hij erg boos is en
                    hij met veel probeert om te gaan op hetzelfde moment. Hij zegt zelfs dat hij er klaar voor is iemand
                    in het graf te stoppen en daarvoor niet wilt wachten. Op het eerste gezicht lijkt het alsof MLM het
                    over een fysiek persoon heeft, maar als we denken aan welke mentale problemen MLM heeft zou je
                    kunnen beargumenteren dat hij het over zichzelf heeft, of een gedeelte van hem. Misschien, net zoals
                    in Chapter I: Quiet! Praat hij over een gedeelte van hemzelf zoals de drill meester, waarmee hij zo
                    klaar mee is dat hij absoluut alles gaat doen om hem te eindigen. Ook komt er naar voren hoe MLM op
                    atletiek ook moeite heeft zich kalm te houden, terwijl de paniek aanvallen hem overspoelen. </p>

                    <p>Mijn Duistere Kant:</p>
                    <p>Ben niet zoals anderen wat had je verwacht <br>
                        Lachend dachten vele gasten dat in elkaar was gezakt, brachten vragen in me op wat had je
                        gedacht <br>
                        Word ik nou echt geacht te wachten al deze lange nachten, <br>
                        Voordat je lichaam in een graf wordt gezakt <br>
                        Sorry maak geen grappen ik had je toch wel gepakt, dat is discipline, nu word ik het zat <br>
                        Ben een stenen hart in een mooie verpakking verpakt <br>
                        In principe, depressieve discipline zien is iets als nicotine is verslavend, <br>
                        Zou veel vrienden verliezen, ik wil niet bedriegen, weet niet waar ik ze aan zou verdienen <br>
                        Wat zou me bezielen, mijn isolatie is iets dat geen van hen bevielen <br>
                        Als ze me bespieden is het kiezen je kiezen te verliezen <br>
                        Terwijl lichamen bevriezen, want het aller aller liefste <br>
                        Maak een einde aan deze trieste trieste crisis <br>
                        Vertel de waarheid ben geen uit de oudheid katholieke priester </p>

                    <p>Ben op atletiek, zou me willen verstoppen <br>
                        Ja de paniek aanvallen willen niet stoppen, hoor mij het kloppen, en voel me <br>
                        Ingekrompen, niet verzonnen, demonen verbonden <br>
                        Kan en zal niet zonder is wat ik heb bevonden, <br>
                        Nu eens opgedonderd is wat er in mijn oren klonken, <br>
                        tijd is op ik hoor de klokken nu wordt het echt gedonder </p>

                    <p>Gebruik medicatie maar voel me eenzaam (eenzaam) <br>
                        Variatie van gevoelens, geen enkel vreedzaam (vreedzaam) <br>
                        Doe er niet toe, heb geen naam (geen naam) <br>
                        Anderen hebben geen clue, tot het eind zal ik alleen staan <br>
                        Ben wat privé, dus raak me niet aan (raak me niet aan) <br>
                        Hou emoties onder controle, laat me niet gaan (laat me niet gaan) <br>
                        Wervelwind aan gevoelens als een orkaan (een orkaan) <br>
                        Van de lange rij zelfhaat sta ik toch echt vooraan </p>

                    <p>Ik kan 16x 70 meter sprinten, ja die pijn kan en zal ik doorstaan, <br>
                        Maar mijn gevoelens gaan mijn gedachten verslinden <br>
                        en dan weet ik eigenlijk niet meer waarvoor ik sta, waarvoor ik ga, <br>
                        Waarvoor ik besta, waarvoor maak ik me klaar <br>
                        Wat is de reden dat ik deze laatste krachten bewaar, <br>
                        Want het einde zie ik al daar <br>
                        Vanuit mijn achterhoofd hoor ik geen maar, <br>
                        Dus wacht tot ogen in de zwarte diepte staren<br>
                        En mijn ziel niet langer het land van de levende bevaart </p>

                    <p>Links en rechts liggen lijken van gevoelen<br>
                        Oh maar de oorlog gaat door, ben niet in vorm (stop) <br>
                        Ja nu wordt het donker, hoor in de verte gedonder, nu komt de storm op, <br>
                        Mij had je, toch niet geklopt, nu wordt er geklopt, <br>
                        Dood voor de de deur, niemand die hem stopt, alle haat in me opgekropt <br>
                        Waar is mijn trots, terwijl ik plots besef, volgens mij weet niemand hoe erg mijn ziel is verrot
                    </p>

                <h4 id="Aard_die_ik_koos">Aard Die Ik Koos</h4>
                <p>De eerste Nederlandse rap MLM ooit heeft geschreven. Hij deed dit om aan de
                    technische kant van zijn rap te werken, zonder dat hij zich zorgen hoefde te maken over de taal, wat
                    problemen verzoorzaakte niet alleen tijdens het schrijven, maar ook tijdens het opnemen. Al is MLM
                    geen grote fan van Nederlandse rap, hij besloot het dus een kans te geven en hij begon ook meer te
                    focussen op de punch lines in zijn nummers. De Aard Die Ik Koos is, als je kijkt naar de lyrics,
                    best goed met een paar stukken die wat sterker staan dan anderen. Iets dat MLM leerde na het opnemen
                    van deze rap was dat hij de luisteraar wat meer tijd moest geven om de informatie te processen,
                    wanneer het te snel ging. Hiernaast legt de Lyrics uit hoe MLM's zelfbeeld wat in elkaar steekt en
                    hoe niks goeds van hem kan komen, omdat hij het is, in zijn ogen een waardeloos stuk vreten dat niet
                    eens waardig genoeg is om mens genoemd te worden.</p>

                    <p>Aard Die Ik Koos:</p>
                    <p>Rap normaal niet in het Nederlands, <br>
                        Maar ik luister naar andermans advies, <br>
                        En verander dan precies. <br>
                        Leef niet langer meer om bang te zijn voor de standaarden die ik elke keer verander <br>
                        Als geen ander, jammer dan, ben geen zanger ben niet lam <br>
                        Oorlog in mijn hoofd als vietnam, zie het dan <br>
                        Ben geen kanjer, ben geen man, <br>
                        Ik kies niet meteen een kant, verlies geen grip hou het in de hand <br>
                        Hier eet een bak vol zand en luister dan </p>

                    <p>Ik heb depressie, correctie <br>
                        Ben overtuigd dat ik waardeloos ben een infectie <br>
                        Ben afgetuigd door de aard die ik koos <br>
                        Sessie op sessie gaat het over mijn obsessie <br>
                        Met discipline, nu wordt het messy </p>

                    <p>Kernovertuigingen verkeerd weet je wat dat betekent, <br>
                        Dat betekent in mijn jonge jongen leven heb ik vele dingen verkeerd begrepen, <br>
                        Is een teken dat ik mezelf probeer te breken, alsof ik mijn ziel ga wreken <br>
                        Observeer, terwijl ik je leer, keer op keer, elke keer meer, niet op jezelf te rekenen meer <br>
                        Ga je fietsen ben je overtuigd dat je wat gaat breken (oh dear), <br>
                        Ja dit is het heden, had ik niet in het verleden, <br>
                        Soms zou ik willen dat de omstandigheden met pushte om mijn wereldbeeld te verbreden, <br>
                        Heb geen probleem met mensen lezen, zelfs als ze hun ware aard proberen te verkleden, <br>
                        Naar jezelf kijken is iets dat weinig mensen deden, <br>
                        Vele mede mensen vermeden in het delen van tijd, <br>
                        Een verkenning die leidt, naar progressie tot in eeuwigheid <br>
                        Van zelfreflectie krijg je geen spijt, <br>
                        Ja ik lijd, maar ik rij in trein, waar maximale potentie is bevrijd <br>
                        Geef geen compliment, ben te incompetent <br>
                        Heb geen talent, ben minder dan elke vent <br>
                        Ben geen fan van mezelf, medelijden als je me kent <br>
                        Schreeuw voor help en ik zal vertrekken vanzelf </p>

                    <p>Ik heb depressie, correctie <br>
                        Ben overtuigd dat ik waardeloos ben een infectie <br>
                        Ben afgetuigd door de aard die ik koos <br>
                        Sessie op sessie gaat het over mijn obsessie <br>
                        Met discipline, nu wordt het messy </p>

                    <p>Ja ik geloof in God, ben christelijk, <br>
                        Snap niet wat mensen verschrikkelijk aan hem vinden want zonder hem hing ik nu al aan een strop,<br>
                        Wacht, stop, iedereen vertelt het me niet te doen, ik lach me kapot <br>
                        Zoveel invloed heb je niet op me, ik schiet dat waanbeeld verrot <br>
                        Als een aanbeeld dat neer stort, <br>
                        Laatste 6 jaar een persoon die me hoort, en dat was maar voor kort <br>
                        Want het lot had bepaald dat het niet zo hoort <br>
                        Hopen dat mijn eigen leven niet eindigt met een moord (whoo)
                    </p>
